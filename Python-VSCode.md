# Python-VSCode :snake:

This file contains information on how to install and handle different Python versions using miniconda. Additionally, we discuss a short introduction on how to set up the **VSCode** IDE to use Python efficiently.

## Miniconda

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of **Anaconda** that includes only conda, Python, its dependencies and few other useful packages (pip, zlib, etc.). 

For Linux, I recommend installing Miniconda using the terminal, as it will simplify the process of browsing and you can directly copy paste from here :wink:. Open a terminal and type the following commands:

```console
echo "export PATH=/home/${USER}/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" >>/.bashrc

```
