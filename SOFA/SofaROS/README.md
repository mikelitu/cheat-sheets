## SofaROS

To use this script make sure you source the setup file for the specific ROS version you want and to use Python 3.8 as your executable. This two classes can be used similar to other *Sofa.Core.Controller*. The original **sofaros.py** file can be found in the [*SofaSoftRobotsPlugin*](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/SoftRobots/tree/master/docs/sofapython3/examples/sofaros).

```
source /opt/ros/ros_distro/setup.bash
